# BetterRest  
A SwiftUI app to help coffee drinkers optimize their sleep schedules using CoreML.

## Overview  
BetterRest is an iOS app built with SwiftUI and CoreML. It uses machine learning to recommend optimal bedtimes based on user input, including wake-up time, desired sleep duration, and daily coffee consumption.
The app demonstrates the power of tabular regression in CoreML to process billions of potential input combinations and generate personalized recommendations.

## Features  
- **Customizable Sleep Recommendations**: Input wake-up time, sleep duration, and coffee intake to get tailored bedtime suggestions.  
- **CoreML Integration**: Utilizes machine learning models trained with tabular regression to predict sleep patterns.  
- **SwiftUI Interface**: Clean and responsive UI for seamless user interaction.

## Technologies Used  
- **Swift**  
- **SwiftUI**  
- **CoreML**

## Disclaimer  
This is a sample project created to demonstrate the use of CoreML within a SwiftUI app. The predictions and recommendations provided are not scientifically accurate and should not be taken seriously. 

## How It Works  
1. Users provide three inputs:  
   - Wake-up time  
   - Desired hours of sleep  
   - Number of cups of coffee consumed daily  
2. The app processes the inputs using a Core ML model trained with sleep pattern data.  
3. A recommended bedtime is displayed to the user.

## Acknowledgments  
This project idea was originally proposed as part of the 100 Days of SwiftUI course by [Paul Hudson](https://github.com/twostraws). The course provided the initial concept and guidance for implementation.
